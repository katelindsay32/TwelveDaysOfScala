# TwelveDaysOfScala

First attempt at messing with Scala. 

Why do int's not have a += operator? That's silly. 
Is there a way to have a method accept a type of var? So that I don't have to assign my int's to a var to use my += operator?

I like that lambda's made it to Java. Neat.

Didn't do any input validation yet, nor any unit tests.

Wrote the gift total method in two different ways to try some things out:
1. Using a collection, filtering and iterating over that
2. Just using a good 'ol for loop
